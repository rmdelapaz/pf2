            <h2>The Art of Character Creation</h2>
            <p>Creating a Pathfinder 2.0 character is like being an architect, chef, and storyteller all at once. You're designing the blueprint (stats), mixing the perfect recipe (abilities), and crafting a compelling narrative (backstory) that will grow and evolve over countless adventures.</p>
            
            <p>Unlike video games where you might pick a class and jump in, tabletop RPG character creation is a deliberate, creative process. Think of it as sculpting a hero from clay - every choice shapes not just what they can do, but who they are.</p>

            <h2>Step One: The Character Concept</h2>
            <p>Before diving into mechanics, start with a story. Who is this person? What drives them? Think of your favorite fictional characters - what makes them memorable isn't their stats, but their personality, goals, and flaws.</p>

            <div class="concept-framework">
                <h3>The Three-Question Framework</h3>

                        <p>Personality, mannerisms, appearance</p>
                        <em>Example: "A cheerful dwarf who never stops talking about ale brewing"</em>
                    </div>
                    <div class="question-box">
                        <h4>üéØ What do they want?</h4>
                        <p>Goals, dreams, ambitions</p>

                        <p>Fears, regrets, obstacles</p>

            <h2>Step Two: Choosing Your Ancestry</h2>
            <p>Ancestry in PF2e is like choosing your character's genetic foundation, but it's much more than just "race." It determines physical capabilities, cultural perspectives, and innate magical abilities. Think of it as your character's biological and cultural inheritance.</p>

                <h3>Understanding Ancestry Features</h3>
                <p>Every ancestry comes with a package of traits that define their capabilities:</p>
                
                <div class="feature-breakdown">
                    <h4>Hit Points (HP)</h4>
                    <p>Think of this as your character's baseline toughness. A dwarf (10 HP) can take more punishment than an elf (6 HP) before falling unconscious.</p>

                    <h4>Ability Score Boosts and Flaws</h4>
                    <p>These represent genetic tendencies. Elves are naturally quick (Dex boost) and smart (Int boost), but their lithe frames make them less hardy (Con flaw).</p>

                    <div class="ability-score-visual">
                        <canvas id="abilityScoreChart" width="600" height="300"></canvas>
                    </div>

                    <h4>Special Abilities</h4>
                    <p>These are the unique traits that make each ancestry special:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Darkvision:</strong> See in the dark (like built-in night vision goggles)</li>
                        <li><strong>Keen Senses:</strong> Enhanced perception (like having superhuman hearing)</li>
                        <li><strong>Resistances:</strong> Natural protection against specific threats</li>
                    </ul>

        <section class="background-exploration">
            <h2>Step Three: Your Character's Background</h2>
            <p>If ancestry is your genetic inheritance, background is your life experience before becoming an adventurer. It's like your character's resume combined with their origin story. A noble fighter and a farmer fighter might have the same combat skills, but completely different social connections and knowledge.</p>

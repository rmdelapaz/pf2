            <h2>Magic: The Ultimate Problem-Solving Tool</h2>
            <p>Magic in Pathfinder 2.0 isn't just about throwing fireballs (though that's certainly fun). It's a sophisticated toolkit that lets you reshape reality, solve complex problems, and express your character's relationship with the fundamental forces of the universe. Think of magic like being a scientist, artist, and engineer all at once - you're manipulating the very fabric of existence through knowledge, creativity, and precise technique.</p>
            
            <p>Unlike many fantasy systems where magic is mysterious and unpredictable, PF2e treats magic as a learned discipline with consistent rules. Imagine if you could study physics so thoroughly that you could temporarily rewrite the laws of gravity or thermodynamics - that's what spellcasters do every day.</p>

            <h2>The Four Magical Traditions</h2>
            <p>Magic isn't one monolithic force - it's like light passing through a prism, splitting into distinct but related traditions. Each tradition represents a different philosophy and approach to manipulating reality, like different schools of thought in science or art.</p>

            <h2>Metamagic: Customizing Your Spells</h2>
            <p>Metamagic is like having a toolkit that lets you modify your spells on the fly. Think of it as being able to add special features to your magical "apps" - making them stronger, faster, or work in new ways.</p>

            <div class="metamagic-overview">
                <h3>How Metamagic Works</h3>
                <p>Most metamagic requires spending an additional action when casting the spell, effectively "overclocking" your magic for enhanced effects.</p>
                
                <div class="metamagic-mechanics">
                    <div class="mechanic-card">
                        <h4>⚡ Action Cost</h4>
                        <p>Most metamagic adds 1 action to your spell's casting time</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Fireball normally costs 2 actions, but Empowered Fireball costs 3</p>
                        <p><strong>Limitation:</strong> Can't use metamagic if it would make a spell cost more than 3 actions</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="mechanic-card">
                        <h4>🎯 Flexibility</h4>
                        <p>Can apply metamagic to any applicable spell you cast</p>
                        <p><strong>Decision Point:</strong> Choose whether to use metamagic when you start casting</p>
                        <p><strong>Resource Trade:</strong> Extra action for enhanced effect</p>
                    </div>

                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Your Fireball's first 2d6 automatically roll 6s</p>
                        <p><strong>Best For:</strong> Damage spells when you need guaranteed high damage</p>
                        <p><strong>Strategic Use:</strong> Finishing off tough enemies, ensuring key targets go down</p>

                        <p><strong>Best For:</strong> Touch spells, staying safe while casting</p>
                        <p><strong>Strategic Use:</strong> Healing allies from safety, attacking from maximum range</p>

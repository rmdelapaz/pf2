            <h2>The Journey of Growth: Understanding Character Advancement</h2>
            <p>Character advancement in Pathfinder 2e is like watching a seedling grow into a mighty oak tree. Each level represents not just more power, but deeper specialization, broader capabilities, and meaningful choices that shape your character's unique identity.</p>

            <p>Think of leveling up as earning a degree in "Heroics" - at each level, you're not just getting stronger, you're learning new skills, discovering hidden talents, and unlocking abilities that reflect your growing experience as an adventurer.</p>

            <h2>The Anatomy of a Level: What You Gain</h2>
            <p>Every time you level up, it's like receiving a carefully curated gift box of improvements. Unlike some games where you just get bigger numbers, Pathfinder 2e gives you a variety of meaningful upgrades that work together like instruments in an orchestra.</p>

            <h3>Hit Points: Your Character's Resilience</h3>
            <p>Hit points represent more than just "how much damage you can take" - they're your character's overall vitality, determination, and ability to keep fighting. Think of them like a professional athlete's endurance - a marathon runner doesn't just have "more health," they have better conditioning, mental toughness, and recovery ability.</p>

            <pre><code>Hit Point Calculation Each Level:
Base HP = Class HP + Constitution Modifier

Example - Human Fighter (CON +2):
Level 1: 10 (Fighter base) + 2 (CON) + 8 (ancestry) = 20 HP
Level 2: 20 + 10 (Fighter) + 2 (CON) = 32 HP
Level 3: 32 + 10 + 2 = 44 HP

Real-world analogy: Like a boxer's conditioning improving 
with each training camp</code></pre>

            <h3>Proficiency Progression: Mastering Your Craft</h3>
            <p>Proficiency in Pathfinder 2e works like real-world skill development. You don't just randomly get better at things - you improve in areas where you focus your training, following natural progression paths.</p>

            <div class="mermaid">

                    A[Untrained<br/>+0] --> B[Trained<br/>+Level+2]
                    B --> C[Expert<br/>+Level+4]
                    C --> D[Master<br/>+Level+6]
                    D --> E[Legendary<br/>+Level+8]
                    
                    style A fill:#f44336
                    style B fill:#ff9800
                    style C fill:#4caf50

                    style E fill:#9c27b0
            </div>

            <p>Think of this like learning to play piano:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Untrained:</strong> You've never touched a piano</li>
                <li><strong>Trained:</strong> You can play "Chopsticks" and simple melodies</li>
                <li><strong>Expert:</strong> You can perform intermediate pieces for an audience</li>
                <li><strong>Master:</strong> You could teach piano or perform professionally</li>
                <li><strong>Legendary:</strong> You're Carnegie Hall material</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Feats: Your Character's Unique Abilities</h2>
            <p>Feats are like collecting specialized tools for your heroic toolkit. Every character gets multiple types of feats as they level, creating a customization system richer than a Swiss Army knife factory.</p>

            <h3>The Four Types of Feats</h3>

            <h4>Ancestry Feats: Your Heritage Awakening</h4>
            <p>These represent your character learning more about their heritage - like a person of Italian descent learning to make authentic pasta from their grandmother. You gain these at 1st, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>

            <pre><code>Example Ancestry Feat Progression (Human):
Level 1: Natural Ambition (bonus 1st-level class feat)
Level 5: Adaptive Adept (bonus cantrip from any tradition)
Level 9: Clever Improviser (become trained in untrained skills)
Level 13: Unconventional Weaponry (gain weapon access)
Level 17: Heroic Presence (inspire allies with leadership)</code></pre>

            <h4>Class Feats: Your Professional Development</h4>
            <p>These are like earning certifications in your chosen field. A fighter learns new combat techniques, while a wizard discovers advanced magical theories. You get these at every even level (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.).</p>

            <pre><code>Example Fighter Class Feat Progression:
Level 2: Power Attack (devastating two-action strike)
Level 4: Intimidating Strike (combine attack with demoralization)
Level 6: Knockdown (trip enemies with weapon attacks)
Level 8: Improved Knockdown (trip multiple enemies)
Level 10: Whirlwind Strike (attack all nearby enemies)</code></pre>

            <h4>Skill Feats: Your Expanding Expertise</h4>
            <p>Like taking continuing education courses, these expand what you can do with your skills. You gain these at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter.</p>

            <pre><code>Example Skill Feat Applications:
Athletics: Quick Climb (climb at full speed)
Stealth: Experienced Smuggler (hide larger objects)
Medicine: Battle Medicine (heal during combat)
Diplomacy: Group Impression (influence multiple people)
Crafting: Magical Crafting (create magic items)</code></pre>

            <h4>General Feats: Universal Life Skills</h4>
            <p>These represent general life experiences and universal abilities that any adventurer might develop, like learning a new language or becoming more resilient. You get these at 3rd level and every 4 levels after.</p>

            <pre><code>Popular General Feats:
Fleet (increase your speed)
Toughness (gain more hit points)
Incredible Initiative (roll initiative twice, take higher)
Fast Recovery (recover faster during rest)
Multilingual (learn additional languages)</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Ability Score Boosts: Growing Stronger</h2>
            <p>Every four levels (5th, 10th, 15th, 20th), you get four ability score boosts. This is like your character having growth spurts - not just physical, but mental and spiritual growth as well.</p>

            <pre><code>Ability Boost Rules:
- Can't boost the same ability score twice in one session
- Can't boost an ability score above 18 using boosts alone
- Must boost different abilities (max one per ability per level)

Example Boost Strategy (Fighter):
Level 5: STR 16→18, CON 14→16, WIS 12→14, CHA 10→12
Level 10: DEX 12→14, INT 12→14, and two others
Level 15: Continue spreading or focus on key abilities</code></pre>

            <h3>Strategic Boost Planning</h3>
            <p>Planning your ability score boosts is like planning a workout routine. You want to strengthen your core abilities while not neglecting areas that support your overall performance.</p>

            <pre><code>Boost Strategy Examples:

Martial Character (Fighter/Ranger/Champion):
Priority 1: Primary attack stat (STR or DEX)
Priority 2: Constitution (survivability)
Priority 3: Wisdom (Perception, saves)
Priority 4: Support stats (depends on build)

Spellcaster (Wizard/Cleric/Sorcerer):
Priority 1: Spellcasting stat (INT/WIS/CHA)
Priority 2: Constitution (survivability)
Priority 3: Dexterity (AC, initiative)
Priority 4: Support stats or secondary casting</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Power Curve: How Characters Evolve</h2>
            <p>Character power in Pathfinder 2e doesn't grow linearly - it grows in waves, like a musician mastering increasingly complex pieces. Each tier of play brings qualitatively different capabilities.</p>

            <h3>Levels 1-4: Learning the Basics</h3>
            <p>Like a medical student's first year, you're learning fundamental skills and basic techniques. Characters are competent but still vulnerable to many threats.</p>

            <div class="mermaid">

                    A[Level 1: Character Creation] --> B[Level 2: First Class Feat<br/>Extra Skill Feat]

                    C --> D[Level 4: Class Feat<br/>Skill Feat]

                    style D fill:#9c27b0
            </div>

            <h3>Levels 5-9: Becoming Capable</h3>
            <p>Like a resident doctor, you're developing real competence. You gain signature abilities and start to feel genuinely heroic.</p>

            <pre><code>Key Level 5 Improvements:
✓ First ability score boosts (4 total)
✓ Ancestry feat
✓ Skill increases (4 total)
✓ Many classes get signature abilities:
  - Fighters: weapon specialization
  - Wizards: 3rd-level spells
  - Rogues: weapon specialization</code></pre>

            <h3>Levels 10-14: Veteran Competence</h3>
            <p>Like a specialist consultant, you're now an expert in your field with some truly impressive capabilities.</p>

            <h3>Levels 15-20: Legendary Heroes</h3>
            <p>Like a world-renowned expert in your field, you can accomplish things that border on the mythical.</p>

            <pre><code>High-Level Capabilities Examples:
Level 15 Fighter: Can cleave through multiple enemies in one swing
Level 17 Wizard: Can stop time or reshape reality
Level 19 Rogue: Can become invisible and strike vital points unerringly
Level 20 Champion: Can literally come back from death to protect others</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Customization Strategies: Building Your Unique Hero</h2>
            <p>Character advancement in PF2e is like creating a custom recipe. You start with a base (your class), add key ingredients (ancestry and background), and then season to taste with your feat choices and ability score improvements.</p>

            <h3>The Specialist vs Generalist Approach</h3>
            <p>You can build your character like a Swiss Army knife (lots of useful tools) or like a precision instrument (exceptional at one thing).</p>

            <pre><code>Specialist Build Example (Damage-Focused Fighter):
Class Feats: Power Attack → Furious Focus → Improved Critical
Skill Feats: All combat-related (Intimidation, Athletics)
General Feats: Toughness, Fleet, Incredible Initiative
Result: Devastating in combat, limited outside options

Generalist Build Example (Versatile Fighter):
Class Feats: Mix combat and utility options
Skill Feats: Diverse skills (Medicine, Diplomacy, Stealth)
General Feats: Multilingual, Skill Training
Result: Capable in many situations, less optimized damage</code></pre>

            <h3>Multiclass Dedication: Learning New Trades</h3>
            <p>Multiclass dedications are like getting a minor degree alongside your major. You can become a fighter who studies magic, or a wizard who learns some roguish tricks.</p>

            <pre><code>Multiclass Dedication Requirements:
1. Must have 14+ in the new class's key ability score
2. Take the dedication feat (usually level 2+)
3. Cannot take another dedication until you have 2+ feats
   from your current dedication

Example: Fighter with Wizard Dedication
Level 2: Wizard Dedication (gain spellcasting)
Level 4: Basic Wizard Spellcasting
Level 6: Now can take another dedication or continue wizard</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Practical Advancement Planning</h2>
            <p>Planning your character's advancement is like planning a career path. You want to know where you're going while remaining flexible enough to adapt to opportunities.</p>

            <h3>The Character Build Document</h3>
            <p>Many successful players create an advancement plan, like a business plan for their character's growth.</p>

            <pre><code>Sample Character Plan Template:

CHARACTER: Lyra Brightblade (Human Fighter)
CONCEPT: Protective warrior who inspires allies

ABILITY PRIORITY: STR > CON > CHA > WIS > DEX > INT

FEAT PROGRESSION PLAN:
Level 1: Natural Ambition (Power Attack)
Level 2: Intimidating Strike
Level 3: Toughness
Level 4: Quick Shield Block
Level 5: Ancestry Feat - Inspire Heroics
Level 6: Guardian's Deflection

MULTICLASS PLAN: Champion Dedication at Level 2
GOAL: Become the ultimate protector-warrior</code></pre>

            <h3>Adaptation and Flexibility</h3>
            <p>Like a good chef who adjusts recipes based on available ingredients, be ready to adapt your plan based on campaign needs and party composition.</p>

            <pre><code>Adaptation Examples:
Campaign has lots of undead → consider Disrupting Weapons feat
Party lacks healer → invest in Medicine skill and Battle Medicine
Facing many spellcasters → prioritize Will saves and counterspells
Urban campaign → emphasize social skills over wilderness survival</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Real-World Applications and Practice</h2>
            
            <h3>Character Advancement Simulation</h3>
            <p>Practice makes perfect! Try advancing a sample character through several levels to understand the rhythm of growth.</p>

            <pre><code>Exercise: Level a Fighter from 1st to 5th level

Starting Stats:
Human Fighter, STR 18, DEX 12, CON 16, INT 10, WIS 14, CHA 10

Level 1:
- HP: 10 + 6 (CON) + 8 (Human) = 24
- Feats: Natural Ambition (Power Attack)
- Skills: Choose 3 + INT (3 total)

Level 2:
- HP: 24 + 10 + 3 = 37
- Class Feat: Choose one (Intimidating Strike?)
- Skill Feat: Choose one

Level 3:
- HP: 37 + 10 + 3 = 50
- General Feat: Choose one
- Skill Increases: 4 skills improve by one rank

Level 4:
- HP: 50 + 10 + 3 = 63
- Class Feat: Choose one
- Skill Feat: Choose one

Level 5:
- HP: 63 + 10 + 3 = 76
- Ancestry Feat: Choose one
- Ability Boosts: 4 different abilities
- Skill Increases: 4 skills improve
- Weapon Specialization: +2 damage with weapons</code></pre>

            <h3>Campaign Integration</h3>
            <p>Consider how your character's growth fits into the story. Your advancement should reflect not just mechanical optimization, but character development and story progression.</p>

            <pre><code>Story-Driven Advancement Examples:

After defeating a master swordsman:
→ Take Advanced Weapon Training feat

After discovering ancient magical texts:
→ Take Wizard Dedication

After protecting villages from bandits:
→ Develop Leadership-themed general feats

After surviving harsh wilderness:
→ Invest in Survival and related skill feats</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Common Advancement Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h2>
            <p>Learning from others' mistakes is like getting a GPS for your character development journey - it helps you avoid common wrong turns.</p>

            <h3>The "Shiny Object" Syndrome</h3>
            <p>Don't just pick feats because they sound cool. Make sure they work together like instruments in an orchestra.</p>

            <pre><code>Example of Poor Synergy:
Fighter taking:
- Power Attack (two-action attack)
- Dual-Weapon Warrior (focuses on two weapons)
- Shield Block (requires shield and hand)

Problem: These don't work together effectively

Better Approach:
Choose a focus and build around it:
Option A: Two-handed weapon + Power Attack + Furious Focus
Option B: Sword and shield + Shield feats
Option C: Dual weapons + Twin Parry + Double Slice</code></pre>

            <h3>Neglecting Fundamentals</h3>
            <p>Don't ignore basic improvements in favor of flashy abilities. Sometimes the most important upgrade is increasing your Constitution or taking Toughness.</p>

            <h3>Planning Too Rigidly</h3>
            <p>While planning is good, don't be so locked into a build that you can't adapt to your actual play experience.</p>
